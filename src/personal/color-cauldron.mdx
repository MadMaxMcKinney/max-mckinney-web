This was a weekend project that grew to a week-long project where I explored a variety of design/development techniques that had been on my mind recently. 3D modeling with Spline and Blender, micro animations seen through the home page cards and loading animations, AI powered functionality with Open AI's GPT3.5-Turbo model with additional context setting, all wrapped together on a frontend built on SvelteKit.
