Joining the Security organization within IBM, I built and attached a design team to an existing engineering-only product team, IBM's Risk Manager. There was a unique opportunity to elevate the product experience, create UI consistency, find new ways to bring delight to our users. With such ambition it became clear the biggest challenge would come in the form of cross-functional alignment and communication. This is how I built a design team that blurred the previously solid boundaries of design/development within Risk Manager over the course of a year.
