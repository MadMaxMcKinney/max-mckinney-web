Figma's Product Education team provides users with valuable learning resources in the form of videos, playground files, interactive content, and documentation. As the first Education Designer at Figma, I helped define what the role should look like and how it could best serve the team and the company. Product design and design leadership allowed me to serve as a subject matter expert for the team, bringing real world examples and use-cases that more accurately reflect the needs of Figma's users.

#### Lead content use-case research and design efforts

Spearheaded research initiatives to identify how users interact with and benefit from educational materials. This research informed the development of tailored educational content that addresses specific user needs, learning styles, and engagement preferences within the context of design assets for Product Education's content.

A core principle of education design that I identified through this work was "Don't be distracting". This principle is about creating educational content that is engaging and informative without being overwhelming or distracting. This principle guided the development of educational content that is clear, concise, and easy to understand, while balancing the need for depth and detail.
